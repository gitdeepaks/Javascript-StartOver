# Section Intro

This is not a Node.js course, however, I do want you to be familiar with it. We already talked about what Node.js is, we installed it and we have used NPM along with CommonJS modules. So you already know the absolute basics.

In this section, I want to introduce you to some of the built-in Node.js modules. We won't be covering all of them. I haven't even used all of them, but we'll cover the ones that are really common that you'll probably run into at some point. We will look at the following modules:

- fs: Allows us to work with the file system, meaning we can do things like read files, create files and folders, move files around and delete files.
- path: Gives us a bunch of helpers to deal with file paths. This is especially helpful because file paths can look different depending on which operating system is being used.
- os: Methods and properties that have to do with the platform or operating system
- url: Helpers for parsing and formatting urls
- querystring - Helpers for  working with querystrings from URLs. We'll actually look at the url and querystring modules together
- http - Handles http requests and responses. We can create a very simpme webserver with this module

I know we're starting to move pretty quickly, but I wanted this course to basically be a JavaScript bootcamp and I want to give you as much information as possible. If you feel like you're not ready for Node.js, that's absolutely fine. You can take this course any way that you'd like. Alright, so in the nect lesson, we'll jump into the Node.js `fs` module.
