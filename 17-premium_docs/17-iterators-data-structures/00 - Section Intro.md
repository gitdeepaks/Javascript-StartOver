# Section Intro

In this section we're going to cover a few things related to concepts that are a little more advanced and not as common. We're going to talk about `iterators`, which are objects that defines a sequence of values. `Generators`, which are used to create iterators and then we're going to move to data structures including `sets` and `maps`, which are built-in to JavaScript, but we're also going to create some data structures that are well known in computer science, but not built in to JavaScript. This includes `stacks`, `queues` and `linked lists`. What we'll do is create some classes that allow us to instantiate an object and give it methods to behave like these data structures. So this stuff is a bit more advanced, but I think you'll learn a lot as we go. So let's get into it.
