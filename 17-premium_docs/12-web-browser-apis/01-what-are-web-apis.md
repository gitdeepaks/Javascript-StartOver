# What Are Web/Browser APIs?

Web APIs, also known as browser APIs are a set of tools that allow developers to interact with the browser and its features. They are not part of the core JavaScript language, but they are built into the browser and can be accessed using JavaScript. We don't need to use any external libraries to use them, they are already built into the browser.

We have already used a few Web APIs in previous chapters, such as the DOM API, the Fetch API and the localStorage API. In this section, we are going to dive into some others and create some small projects using them.

The web APIs that we will be going over include:

- The Geolocation API
- The Canvas API
- The Web Audio API
- The Web Video API
- The WebRTC API
- The Web Workers API
- The WebSockets API
- The Web Animation API
- The Web Speech API
- The Web Bluetooth API
