# Flixx App Project Intro

In this project, we are going to build a movie info application that will fetch data from the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API and display it in a nice way. The app will have the following features:

- Display the most popular movies
- Display the most popular TV shows
- Show specific movie details
- Show specific TV show details
- Display the 'Now Playing' movies in a slider
- Allow users to search for movies and TV shows
- Have pagination for search results

We will be working with the fetch api, async/await, the DOM and pretty much everything that we have talked about up until this point.
