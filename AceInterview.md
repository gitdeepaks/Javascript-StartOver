## JavaScript Fundamentals

### Var, Let, Const

**Explanation:**
Understanding variable declarations is crucial in JavaScript:

- `var`: Function-scoped or globally scoped if not inside a function. Can be redeclared and updated.
- `let`: Block-scoped. Cannot be redeclared in the same scope but can be updated.
- `const`: Block-scoped. Cannot be redeclared or updated. The value must be initialized during declaration.

**Diagram:**

```plaintext
{
  var a = 1;   // Accessible outside this block
  let b = 2;   // Only accessible within this block
  const c = 3; // Only accessible within this block, cannot be reassigned
}
console.log(a); // Accessible
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
console.log(c); // ReferenceError
```

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// var example
function varExample() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2; // Same variable as outer x
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 2
}

// let example
function letExample() {
  let y = 1;
  if (true) {
    let y = 2; // Different variable from outer y
    console.log(y); // 2
  }
  console.log(y); // 1
}

// const example
const z = 1;
// z = 2; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

### Map, Filter, Reduce (and their Polyfills)

**Explanation:**
These are powerful array methods in JavaScript:

- `map()`: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an original array.
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.
- `reduce()`: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

**Code Examples:**

```javascript
// map example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]

// filter example
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2]

// reduce example
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);
console.log(sum); // 6
```

**Polyfills:**

```javascript
// map polyfill
Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    result.push(callback(this[i], i, this));
  }
  return result;
};

// filter polyfill
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callback) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (callback(this[i], i, this)) {
      result.push(this[i]);
    }
  }
  return result;
};

// reduce polyfill
Array.prototype.myReduce = function (callback, initialValue) {
  let accumulator = initialValue !== undefined ? initialValue : this[0];
  let startIndex = initialValue !== undefined ? 0 : 1;
  for (let i = startIndex; i < this.length; i++) {
    accumulator = callback(accumulator, this[i], i, this);
  }
  return accumulator;
};

// Usage examples
console.log([1, 2, 3].myMap((x) => x * 2)); // [2, 4, 6]
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4].myFilter((x) => x % 2 === 0)); // [2, 4]
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4].myReduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)); // 10
```

### Functions

**Explanation:**
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task, executed when "called" (invoked). Understanding different function types is essential.

**Types of Functions:**

1. **Function Declaration:**

   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log("Hello!");
   }
   ```

2. **Function Expression:**

   ```javascript
   const greet = function () {
     console.log("Hello!");
   };
   ```

3. **Arrow Function:**
   ```javascript
   const greet = () => {
     console.log("Hello!");
   };
   ```

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Function declaration
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Function expression
const subtract = function (a, b) {
  return a - b;
};

// Arrow function
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // 2
console.log(multiply(5, 3)); // 15
```

### Closures

**Explanation:**
A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope. It "remembers" the environment in which it was created.

**Diagram:**

```plaintext
function outer() {
  let count = 0;  // This variable is "closed over"
  function inner() {
    count++;  // inner function has access to count
    console.log(count);
  }
  return inner;
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

**Code Example:**

```javascript
function makeAdder(x) {
  // x is "remembered" by the returned function
  return function (y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

const add5 = makeAdder(5);
console.log(add5(2)); // 7
console.log(add5(3)); // 8

const add10 = makeAdder(10);
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
console.log(add10(3)); // 13
```

### Currying

**Explanation:**
Currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument. It allows partial application of a function's arguments.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Non-curried function
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

// Curried version
function curryAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(add(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(curryAdd(1)(2)(3)); // 6

// Partial application
const add1 = curryAdd(1);
const add1and2 = add1(2);
console.log(add1and2(3)); // 6
```

### Objects

**Explanation:**
Objects are collections of key-value pairs. The values can be properties or methods (functions). Understanding object creation and manipulation is crucial in JavaScript.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Object literal
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Hello, my name is John

// Object.create()
const personPrototype = {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const john = Object.create(personPrototype);
john.name = "John";
john.greet(); // Hello, my name is John

// Constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const jane = new Person("Jane", 25);
jane.greet(); // Hello, my name is Jane
```

### 'this' Keyword

**Explanation:**
The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used:

- In a method, `this` refers to the owner object.
- Alone, `this` refers to the global object.
- In a function, `this` refers to the global object (in non-strict mode).
- In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getNameArrow: () => {
    return this.name; // 'this' is lexically bound in arrow functions
  },
};

console.log(obj.getName()); // Alice
console.log(obj.getNameArrow()); // undefined (or window.name in a browser)

// Function borrowing
const obj2 = { name: "Bob" };
console.log(obj.getName.call(obj2)); // Bob

// 'this' in event handlers
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // refers to the button element
});
```

### Call, Bind & Apply

**Explanation:**
These methods allow you to explicitly set the `this` value for executing a function:

- `call()`: Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one.
- `apply()`: Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
- `bind()`: Returns a new function, permanently bound to the specified `this` value.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
}

const person = { name: "Bob" };

// Using call
greet.call(person, "Hello", "!"); // Hello, Bob!

// Using apply
greet.apply(person, ["Hi", "."]); // Hi, Bob.

// Using bind
const boundGreet = greet.bind(person);
boundGreet("Hey", "?"); // Hey, Bob?

// Partial application with bind
const greetBob = greet.bind(person, "Howdy");
greetBob("!"); // Howdy, Bob!
```

### Promises

**Explanation:**
Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an API call
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
        resolve(`Data fetched from ${url}`);
      } else {
        reject(`Failed to fetch from ${url}`);
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return fetchData("https://api.example.com/moredata");
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });

// Using Promise.all
Promise.all([
  fetchData("https://api.example.com/data1"),
  fetchData("https://api.example.com/data2"),
  fetchData("https://api.example.com/data3"),
])
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results); // Array of results from all promises
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("One or more requests failed:", error);
  });
```

### Debouncing

**Explanation:**
Debouncing ensures that a function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last called. This is useful for optimizing performance, especially for functions that are called frequently.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
const expensiveOperation = () => {
  console.log("Expensive operation performed");
};

const debouncedOperation = debounce(expensiveOperation, 300);

// This will only log once, 300ms after the last call
window.addEventListener("resize", debouncedOperation);
```

### Throttling

**Explanation:**
Throttling ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time period. This is useful for limiting the rate at which a function can fire.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const logMousePosition = (e) => {
  console.log(`Mouse position: ${e.clientX}, ${e.clientY}`);
};

const throttledLogMousePosition = throttle(logMousePosition, 1000);

// This will log at most once per second
document.addEventListener("mousemove", throttledLogMousePosition);
```

### Event Propagation

**Explanation:**
Event propagation is the mechanism in the DOM by which events flow through the document. It happens in three phases:

1. **Capturing Phase**: The event starts from the root and travels down to the target element.
2. **Target Phase**: The event reaches the target element itself.
3. **Bubbling Phase**: After reaching the target, the event bubbles back up through the DOM tree to the root.

**Code Example:**

```html
<div id="parent">
  Parent
  <div id="child">Child</div>
</div>
```

### Compose and Pipe

**Explanation:**

- **Compose**: Executes a series of functions from right to left.
- **Pipe**: Similar to compose, but executes the functions from left to right.

These are useful for creating more readable and maintainable code by combining multiple functions.

**Code Example:**

````javascript
// Compose function
const compose = (...functions) => (args) =>
  functions.reduceRight((arg, fn) => fn(arg), args);

// Pipe function
const pipe = (...functions) => (args) =>
  functions.reduce((arg, fn) => fn(arg), args);

// Example functions
const add10 = (x) => x + 10;
const multiply2 = (x) => x * 2;
const subtract5 = (x) => x - 5;

// Using compose (right to left)
const composedFunction = compose(subtract5, multiply2, add10);
console.log(composedFunction(5)); // ((5 + 10) * 2) - 5 = 25

// Using pipe (left to right)
const pipedFunction = pipe(add10, multiply2, subtract5);
console.log(pipedFunction(5)); // ((5 + 10) * 2) - 5 = 25


### Prototypes

**Explanation:**
Every object in JavaScript has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which is an object from which the current object can inherit methods and properties. This forms the basis of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

// Creating instances
const person1 = new Person('Alice');
const person2 = new Person('Bob');

person1.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice
person2.greet(); // Hello, my name is Bob

// Demonstrating prototype chain
console.log(person1.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
console.log(Person.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true

// Extending prototypes
Person.prototype.introduce = function() {
  console.log(`I'm ${this.name}, nice to meet you!`);
};

person1.introduce(); // I'm Alice, nice to meet you!

// Object.create for prototypal inheritance
const personProto = {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
};

const john = Object.create(personProto);
john.name = 'John';
john.greet(); // Hello, I'm John
````

### Class and Constructors

**Explanation:**
Classes in JavaScript, introduced in ES6, provide a cleaner syntax for creating objects and implementing inheritance. They are essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const animal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
animal.speak(); // Generic Animal makes a noise.

const dog = new Dog("Rex");
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.

// Demonstrating that classes use prototypal inheritance under the hood
console.log(dog instanceof Dog); // true
console.log(dog instanceof Animal); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype) === Animal.prototype); // true
```

### Event Loop

**Explanation:**
The event loop is JavaScript's mechanism for executing code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. It's crucial for understanding how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.

**Diagram:**

```plaintext
   ┌───────────────────────┐
┌─>│        Call Stack     │
│  └───────────────────────┘
│  ┌───────────────────────┐
│  │    Web APIs/Node.js   │
│  │    Background APIs    │
│  └───────────────────────┘
│  ┌───────────────────────┐
│  │     Callback Queue    │
└──│  (Macrotask Queue)    │
   └───────────────────────┘
   ┌───────────────────────┐
   │     Microtask Queue   │
   └───────────────────────┘
```

**Code Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise resolved");
});

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Promise resolved
// Timeout callback

// Explanation:
// 1. 'Start' is logged immediately.
// 2. setTimeout callback is scheduled (macrotask).
// 3. Promise resolution is scheduled (microtask).
// 4. 'End' is logged.
// 5. Microtask queue is processed: 'Promise resolved' is logged.
// 6. Macrotask queue is processed: 'Timeout callback' is logged.
```

## React Interview Questions

### How React Works Under the Hood

**Explanation:**
React creates a virtual DOM (a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM). When state changes, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing algorithm), determines the minimal changes required, and updates the real DOM efficiently.

**Diagram:**

```plaintext
[JSX] --> [Virtual DOM] --> [Diffing] --> [Real DOM]
          ^                                |
          |                                |
          └────────── State Change ────────┘
```

### React Rendering Process (Virtual DOM and Diffing Algorithm)

**Explanation:**

1. **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight copy of the real DOM that React keeps in memory.
2. **Diffing Algorithm**: Compares the previous and current virtual DOM trees to find out what has changed.
3. **Reconciliation**: The process of updating the DOM with those changes.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// When setCount is called:
// 1. React creates a new Virtual DOM with the updated count
// 2. It compares this new Virtual DOM with the previous one
// 3. It identifies that only the text content of <p> has changed
// 4. It updates only that specific part in the real DOM
```

### Most Asked Interview Questions

#### Ques 1: What is React and why is it used?

**Answer:**
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React is used because it:

- Enhances performance via the virtual DOM.
- Encourages reusable components.
- Simplifies complex UIs with declarative code.
- Provides a robust ecosystem and community support.
- Enables building of single-page applications (SPAs) efficiently.

#### Ques 2: What is JSX, and why is it used?

**Answer:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. JSX is used in React to describe the UI structure, making the code more readable and easier to write.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

// JSX allows embedding expressions
const name = "John";
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;

// JSX can represent complex structures
const list = (
  <ul>
    {["apple", "banana", "orange"].map((item) => (
      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

JSX is transpiled to regular JavaScript function calls and objects before it's run in the browser.

#### Ques 3: What is a React component?

**Answer:**
A React component is a reusable piece of UI that can be either a function or a class. Components accept inputs called props and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
// Functional Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Class Component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

#### Ques 4: What is the difference between state and props in React?

**Answer:**

- **Props**: Props (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed to a React component. They are used to customize the component's behavior and appearance.
- **State**: State is an object that holds data that can change over time. It is managed within the component and can be updated using the `setState` method.

#### Ques 5: What is the purpose of keys in React lists?

**Answer:**
Keys are special attributes used to uniquely identify elements in a list. They help React efficiently update the DOM when the list changes. Keys should be unique and stable across renders.

#### Ques 6: What is the significance of the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method?

**Answer:**
The `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method allows a React component to determine whether it should re-render based on changes to its props or state. By implementing this method, components can optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

#### Ques 7: What is the role of higher-order components (HOCs) in React?

**Answer:**
Higher-order components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component. They are used to reuse code, add functionality, or modify component behavior. HOCs are a powerful technique for code composition and abstraction in React.

#### Ques 8: How does React handle forms?

**Answer:**
React handles forms by using controlled components. Controlled components have their state managed by React, and their values are updated via event handlers. This allows React to efficiently handle form inputs and validation.

#### Ques 9: What is the purpose of context in React?

**Answer:**
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for sharing global state or configuration that is needed by many components.

#### Ques 10: How does React handle errors?

**Answer:**
React provides error boundaries, which are components that catch JavaScript errors during rendering and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application. Error boundaries can be created using the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method or the `ErrorBoundary` component.

#### Ques 11: What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useEffect` hook allows functional components to perform side effects, such as data fetching or subscriptions, in a declarative way. It replaces the `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods in class components.

#### Ques 12: What is the role of the `useContext` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useContext` hook allows functional components to consume context values without having to use a render prop or a higher-order component. It simplifies the process of accessing context values and makes it easier to share data between components.

#### Ques 13: What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useMemo` hook allows functional components to memoize expensive computations. It only re-computes the memoized value when one of its dependencies changes. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

#### Ques 14: What is the role of the `useCallback` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useCallback` hook allows functional components to memoize callback functions. It returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of its dependencies changes. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

#### Ques 15: What is the purpose of the `useReducer` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to the `useState` hook for managing complex state logic. It allows components to use a reducer function to update state based on actions. This can be useful for managing state with multiple sub-values or for implementing complex state transitions.

#### Ques 16: What is the role of the `useRef` hook in React?

**Answer:**
The `useRef` hook allows functional components to create mutable references to DOM elements or to store values that persist across renders. It returns a ref object that can be used to access the current value of the reference.

#### Ques 17: What is the purpose of the `React.memo` higher-order component?

**Answer:**
The `React.memo` higher-order component allows functional components to skip unnecessary re-renders by memoizing their output. It compares the previous and current props of the component and only re-renders if they have changed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

#### Ques 18: What is the role of the `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense` components in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.lazy` component allows components to be lazily loaded, which means they are only loaded when they are first rendered. This can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application. The `React.Suspense` component allows components to display a fallback UI while they are being loaded.

#### Ques 19: What is the purpose of the `React.forwardRef` higher-order component?

**Answer:**
The `React.forwardRef` higher-order component allows components to forward refs to their children. This can be useful for accessing DOM elements or for implementing custom components that need to be integrated with form libraries.

#### Ques 20: What is the role of the `React.Fragment` component in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.Fragment` component allows components to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It is useful for grouping related elements together without adding unnecessary wrappers.

#### Ques 21: What is the purpose of the `React.Profiler` component in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.Profiler` component allows components to measure performance and identify bottlenecks. It can be used to measure the rendering time of components and their children, and to identify components that are causing performance issues.

#### Ques 22: What is the role of the `React.StrictMode` component in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.StrictMode` component allows components to be rendered in a strict mode, which enables additional checks and warnings for common issues. It can help to catch potential problems early in the development process.

#### Ques 23: What is the purpose of the `React.PureComponent` class in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.PureComponent` class is a base class for React components that implements the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method with a shallow comparison of props and state. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

#### Ques 24: What is the role of the `React.createContext` function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.createContext` function allows components to create a new context object. Context objects can be used to share data between components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

#### Ques 25: What is the purpose of the `React.createRef` function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.createRef` function allows components to create a new ref object. Ref objects can be used to access DOM elements or to store values that persist across renders.

#### Ques 26: What is the role of the `React.createPortal` function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.createPortal` function allows components to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This can be useful for implementing modals, tooltips, and other components that need to be rendered outside of their parent container.

#### Ques 27: What is the purpose of the `React.createElement` function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.createElement` function allows components to create React elements programmatically. It is used internally by JSX to create elements, but it can also be used directly to create elements dynamically.

#### Ques 28: What is the role of the `React.cloneElement function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.cloneElement` function allows components to clone and modify existing React elements. It can be used to add props to elements, replace children, or modify other properties.

#### Ques 29: What is the purpose of the `React.isValidElement` function in React?

**Answer:**
The `React.isValidElement` function allows components to check whether a given object is a valid React element. It can be used to validate input to components or to check the output of other functions.

## 10. Scalable Poll Widget Component

**Objective:**

- Build a Poll Widget Component.
- Focus on requirement gathering, HLD, LLD, API structure, and optimizations.

**Requirement Gathering:**

- **Features:**
- Display poll question and options.
- Allow users to vote.
- Show real-time results.

**High-Level Design (HLD):**

- **Components:**
- `Poll`: Main component handling poll display and voting.
- **API Structure:**
- **Endpoints:**
- `GET /polls/:id`: Fetch poll data.
- `POST /polls/:id/vote`: Submit a vote.

**Low-Level Design (LLD):**

- **State Management:**
- Use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage poll data.
- **Optimizations:**
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates (if applicable).

**Code Implementation:**

1. **Poll.js:**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function Poll({ pollId }) {
  const [poll, setPoll] = useState(null);
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(`/polls/${pollId}`).then((response) => setPoll(response.data));
  }, [pollId]);

  const submitVote = () => {
    axios
      .post(`/polls/${pollId}/vote`, { optionId: selectedOption })
      .then((response) => {
        setPoll(response.data);
      });
  };

  if (!poll) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{poll.question}</h2>
      {poll.options.map((option) => (
        <div key={option.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="radio"
              name="poll"
              value={option.id}
              onChange={() => setSelectedOption(option.id)}
            />
            {option.text} - {option.votes} votes
          </label>
        </div>
      ))}
      <button onClick={submitVote} disabled={!selectedOption}>
        Vote
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Poll;
```

**Optimizations:**

- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections to update poll results in real-time.
- **Caching**: Use client-side caching to reduce API calls.

## 1. Utilizing React DevTools: Components and Profiler Tabs

### Components Tab

The **Components** tab allows you to inspect the component hierarchy, props, state, and hooks of your React application.

#### Key Features:

- **Inspect Props and State**: View and edit props and state of components in real-time.
- **Highlight Updates**: Visualize component re-renders to identify unnecessary updates.

#### How to Use:

1. **Install React DevTools**: Available as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.
2. **Open DevTools**: Navigate to the **Components** tab.
3. **Inspect Components**: Click on components to view their props and state.

### Profiler Tab

The **Profiler** tab helps you measure the performance of your application by recording render times.

#### Key Features:

- **Record Performance**: Start and stop profiling sessions.
- **Analyze Render Times**: View commit times and identify slow components.
- **Flame Graphs**: Visualize component hierarchies and render durations.

#### How to Use:

1. **Navigate to Profiler Tab**: In React DevTools, go to the **Profiler** tab.
2. **Record Profiling Session**: Click **Start profiling** and interact with your app.
3. **Stop Profiling**: Click **Stop profiling** to analyze the results.

#### Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log("Counter render");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

Use the **Profiler** to check if `Counter` re-renders unnecessarily.

## 2. Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

In CSR, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and JavaScript files, which render the content dynamically.

#### Pros:

- Rich interactivity.
- Less server load.

#### Cons:

- Initial load might be slow.
- SEO challenges.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

In SSR, the server renders the initial HTML page, which is sent to the client.

#### Pros:

- Faster initial load.
- Better SEO.

#### Cons:

- Increased server load.
- More complex setup.

### Implementing CSR and SSR

#### CSR with Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This setup uses CSR by default.

#### SSR with Next.js:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

**Example of SSR in Next.js:**

```jsx
// pages/index.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from an API
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>;
}

export default HomePage;
```

---

## 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Code splitting divides your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on-demand, improving load times.

### React Lazy Loading

Use `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` to lazy load components.

#### Example:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./HeavyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <HeavyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Webpack Code Splitting

Webpack automatically splits code based on dynamic imports.

#### Example:

```jsx
// Dynamic import
import("./module").then((module) => {
  // Use the module
});
```

---

## 4. Error Boundaries

Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in components below them, preventing the entire app from crashing.

### Creating an Error Boundary

```jsx
import React from "react";

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state to render fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Log error details.
    console.error(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Fallback UI.
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

### Using the Error Boundary

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## 5. Web Vitals

Web Vitals are metrics that capture the user experience of web applications.

### Key Metrics:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures responsiveness.

### Optimizing LCP

- Optimize images.
- Use efficient caching.
- Preload critical resources.

### Optimizing CLS

- Set size attributes on images and videos.
- Avoid inserting content above existing content.

### Measuring Web Vitals

Use Google's [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) library.

#### Example:

```bash
npm install web-vitals
```

```jsx
import { getCLS, getLCP, getFID } from "web-vitals";

getCLS(console.log);
getLCP(console.log);
getFID(console.log);
```

---

## 6. Virtualization

Virtualization renders only the visible portion of large data sets, improving performance.

### Using react-window

Install the library:

```bash
npm install react-window
```

#### Example:

```jsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from "react-window";

const Row = ({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>Row {index}</div>;

function App() {
  return (
    <List height={150} itemCount={1000} itemSize={35} width={300}>
      {Row}
    </List>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 7. Accessibility Essentials

### Semantic HTML

Use appropriate HTML tags.

#### Example:

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div onclick="handleClick()">Click me</div>

<!-- Good -->
<button onclick="handleClick()">Click me</button>
```

### Color Contrast

Ensure text has sufficient contrast with the background.

### Alt Text

Provide `alt` attributes for images.

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" />
```

---

## 8. Higher-Order Components (HOC)

An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

### Why Use HOCs?

- Reuse code logic.
- Inject props or state.

### Example:

```jsx
function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log("Component mounted");
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}

export default withLogger;
```

### Using the HOC:

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>;
}

export default withLogger(MyComponent);
```

---

## 9. Carousel Performance Optimization

Optimizing carousels involves:

- Lazy loading images.
- Throttling slide transitions.
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### Example with Swiper.js:

Install Swiper:

```bash
npm install swiper
```

#### Implementing Lazy Loading:

```jsx
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from "swiper/react";
import "swiper/swiper-bundle.css";

function Carousel() {
  return (
    <Swiper lazy={true}>
      <SwiperSlide>
        <img data-src="image1.jpg" className="swiper-lazy" alt="Slide 1" />
      </SwiperSlide>
      {/* More slides */}
    </Swiper>
  );
}

export default Carousel;
```

---

## 10. Module Pattern in React Apps

The module pattern encapsulates code, exposing only what is necessary.

### Implementing the Module Pattern

#### Counter Module:

```jsx
// counter.js
const CounterModule = (() => {
  let count = 0;

  const increment = () => count++;
  const getCount = () => count;

  return {
    increment,
    getCount,
  };
})();

export default CounterModule;
```

#### Using the Module:

```jsx
import CounterModule from "./counter";

function App() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    CounterModule.increment();
    console.log(CounterModule.getCount());
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>;
}

export default App;
```

---

## 11. Render Props

Render props are techniques for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

### Example:

#### MouseTracker Component:

```jsx
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  state = { x: 0, y: 0 };

  handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      x: e.clientX,
      y: e.clientY,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        {this.props.render(this.state)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Using Render Props:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <MouseTracker
      render={({ x, y }) => (
        <h1>
          The mouse position is ({x}, {y})
        </h1>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
