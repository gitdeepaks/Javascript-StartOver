Certainly! Here are 20 JavaScript questions to help you build logic and problem-solving skills:

1. **Array Basics**:

   - Given an array of numbers, find the maximum and minimum values.
   - Reverse an array without using the built-in reverse method.

2. **String Manipulations**:

   - Count the number of vowels in a string.
   - Check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. **Control Structures**:

   - Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
   - Given a number, determine if it's a prime number.

4. **Function Basics**:

   - Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
   - Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

5. **Objects and Key/Value Pairs**:

   - Given an object, return an array of its values.
   - Check if a given object has a specific property.

6. **Array Advanced**:

   - Remove duplicates from an array.
   - Find the intersection (common elements) of two arrays.

7. **Loops**:

   - Sum all numbers in an array using a for loop.
   - Find the first repeated element in an array.

8. **DOM Manipulations** (if you're into front-end):

   - Change the background color of a paragraph when a button is clicked.
   - Toggle the visibility of an element when a checkbox is checked/unchecked.

9. **Date and Time**:

   - Given a date, determine how many days have passed since that date.
   - Convert a Unix timestamp to a readable date format.

10. **Advanced Functions**:

- Write a function that returns another function. This concept is called a higher-order function.
- Implement a debounce function that prevents a function from being called multiple times within a specified time period.

11. **Asynchronous Operations**:

- Fetch data from a public API and log the data to the console.
- Handle errors in a fetch operation gracefully, showing an error message to the user.

12. **Complex Logic**:

- Flatten a nested array (e.g., [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]], 6] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).
- Implement a basic calculator that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without using `eval()`.

Working on these questions will not only enhance your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts but also prepare you for more complex application development. Remember, the key is to practice regularly and understand the logic behind each solution.
