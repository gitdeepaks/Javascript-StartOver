## React and Related Concepts Documentation

### Ques 1: What is React and why is it used?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React is used for its efficient, declarative, and flexible approach to building web and mobile applications. It enables developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its key feature is the ability to build components, encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

### Ques 2: What is JSX, and why is it used?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe what the UI should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. This makes the code easier to understand and debug as it avoids the usage of complex JavaScript DOM structures. JSX compiles into React `createElement()` calls which forms a tree of React elements that will be used to build the actual DOM.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
````

### Ques 3: What is a React component?

A React component is an independent, reusable code that represents a part of a UI. Components can be functional or class-based. Components come in two types: **Stateful** (also called containers, smart, or class components) and **Stateless** (also called presentational, dumb, or functional components). They can maintain internal state data (stateful components), return JSX via a render function, and accept props to create dynamic parts of the UI.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Ques 4: What is the difference between state and props?

- **State** is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to child components except as props. It is mutable and can be asynchronous.
- **Props** (short for properties) are read-only and immutable data passed to a component from its parent. They are used to pass data and event handlers down to child components.

### Ques 5: What is prop drilling?

Prop drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component down to its deeply nested child components through props. This can make the component hierarchy hard to manage as it grows. React context or state management libraries like Redux are often used to avoid excessive prop drilling.

### Ques 6: What is a React fragment, and why is it used?

A React fragment is a common pattern used in React which lets you return multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. It is useful for grouping a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
  <ChildA />
  <ChildB />
  <ChildC />
</React.Fragment>
```

### Ques 7: How do you define and use state in a React Functional component?

In functional components, the `useState` hook is used to add local state. `useState` returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. Unlike class components, the state in hooks doesn't have to be an object.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Ques 8: How do you define and use state in a React Class component?

In class components, state is a property on the component class itself. You initialize state in the constructor and use `setState` to update it.

```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Ques 9: How do you pass props to a functional component?

Props are passed to functional components in the same way they are passed to class components. The functional component receives a single argument which is an object containing all the props.

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}
```

### Ques 10: What are PropTypes?

PropTypes is a mechanism to ensure that components use the correct data type and pass the right data, and that components use the right type of props, and that receiving components receive the right type of props. It can also provide default values for any properties that are not compulsory.

```jsx
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

### Ques 11: How do you use props in a class component?

Props in class components are accessed through `this.props` in the lifecycle methods and constructor.

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Ques 12: In how many ways can we export/import things from a JS Module?

Items can be exported in two main ways in ES6: named exports and default exports. Named exports allow multiple exports per file, while default exports allow only one default export per module.

```javascript
// Named exports
export const name = "value";

// Default export
export default function () {}

// Importing
import { name } from "./module";
import functionName from "./module";
```

### Ques 13: What is Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or "virtual", representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. The Virtual DOM allows for efficient updates to the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the DOM, which can be slow.

### Ques 14: Reconciliation vs Rendering?

- **Reconciliation** is the process through which React updates the DOM by comparing the current page structure in memory (the virtual DOM) with the new structure. React then determines the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM.
- **Rendering** is the process of creating the JSX returned by React components, which is then converted into HTML by React to be displayed in the browser.

### Ques 15: What is the Diff Algorithm?

The Diff Algorithm is a heuristic used by React to efficiently update the DOM. It compares the previous and next virtual DOMs, calculates the differences, and then makes the minimal number of changes to the real DOM. This algorithm improves the performance of rendering by reducing the time and cost associated with DOM manipulation.
